      May Newsletter Room 302 Monday, May 20th, 2019
Dear Parents,
Thank you very much for your support for our fundraising event, Laps for Lincoln. One of the rewards (challenges) our students wanted was eating lunch in the classroom. Some of my former students join me for lunch on Fridays, so when we had our lunch in our classroom a couple of weeks ago, our classroom was quite crowded but was filled with joyful talk and laughter.

      April Newsletter Room 302 Monday, April 22th, 2019
Dear Parents,
Our students have started practicing Taiko drumming. They have learned some basic facts about playing Taiko: using the wrist to strike the drum rather than using just their arm muscles, saying the different sounds we make in Taiko, which is called kuchisho-ga, and teamwork. Their enthusiasm for learning and memorizing the movement is amazing. Each grade is learning a different song right now.

 “The child is endowed with unknown powers, which can guide us to a radiant future. If what we really want is a new world, then education must take as its aim the development of these hidden possibilities.” &ndash; Dr. Maria Montessori

Dear Parents,
February was a hectic month to be sure; I want to sincerely thank all of you for your support for both me and our class.
I shared with you in my January Newsletter that we as a class read the book, Peace Week, and have been putting into practice some of the principles we learned. This month, we have been learning about Desmond Tutu and Martin Luther King, Jr.

Dear Parents,
Happy New Year to you all!
First of all, I would like to thank you for the generous gifts I received at the end of the first semester. Thank you so much for your love and support. I am blessed by having all of your children in my classroom but you have blessed me even more!
In Japan, many children and adults start the new year by doing calligraphy writing.

      December Newsletter Room 302 Monday, December 17th, 2018
Dear Parents,
We have had a busy last several weeks with things such as our iReady mid-year assessments, practicing making origami cranes, making Christmas/holiday ornaments, writing Christmas/holiday cards, writing winter stories, making “gingerbread man” stories, winter poems, and all of our normal Montessori works! I cannot forget to mention that we have been practicing songs for our gathering this Friday, December 21st. We are going to celebrate our first semester of this school year with songs, tea, and origami.

Dear Parents,
Just a couple of weeks before our Thanksgiving Break, our class worked hard on writing that will be made into a real book. Thank you very much for responding to me despite the short notice. I have submitted everyone’s writing before our break. The books that were ordered will arrive just before our winter break. The title is “Winter Wonderland with All of Us.

      October Newsletter Room 302 Monday, October 29th, 2018
Dear Parents,
Thank you very much for coming to our Parent/Teacher Conferences. (There are a couple more conferences left and I am looking forward to seeing those parents as well!) It was nice to see all of you and get to know more about you and your child. I asked several parents about their hopes/dreams for their children. Some of your responses include “I want my child to have the joy of learning”, “I want my child to continue to be artistic”, “We want our child to love him/herself”, “We want our child to be happy and have self confidence”, “I want my child to be living their full potential”, “We want our child to pursue his/her passion”, etc.
