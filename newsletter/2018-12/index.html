<p>Dear Parents,</p>

<p>We have had a busy last several weeks with things such as our iReady mid-year assessments, practicing making origami cranes, making Christmas/holiday ornaments, writing Christmas/holiday cards, writing winter stories, making “gingerbread man” stories, winter poems, and all of our normal Montessori works! I cannot forget to mention that we have been practicing songs for our gathering this Friday, December 21st. We are going to celebrate our first semester of this school year with songs, tea, and origami. If you can join us, please come to our classroom (room 302) at 2 PM this Friday. Your child would love to serve some tea for you so please do not forget to bring your mug!</p>

<p>I made a “tiny origami crane in a glass ball” ornament several years ago with older children when I was teaching upper elementary class. Your children are making one of these ornaments for you! It was an easy project for my upper elementary students as they were older and they learned how to make the origami crane quickly. This time, though, I am amazed to see how quickly some of the very young students learned how to fold the crane. They made one or two cranes with 6 in x 6 in origami paper first. Then they practiced it with ¼ size origami paper and finally they made a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> size version for the ornament. Some needed more practice than others, but almost everyone was determined to make the final one on their own. I have mentioned the benefits of origami in a previous newsletter but I want to say it again as I see my students enjoy it very much and this is something you can enjoy with your children at home. Sewing, embroidering, knitting and crocheting are other things I would highly recommend doing with your children at home, but origami is definitely easy to do together.</p>

<p>A letter, “Intent to Return to Lincoln Elementary” was sent home last Thursday. Please have your child bring the form back to school as soon as possible. It is due this Friday, December 21st.</p>

<p>It has been such a joy to work with your children this semester. Thank you very much for all the support you have given to us. I am looking forward to having another great semester with the children.</p>

<p>Please have a safe and fun winter break. Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Atsuko O’Keefe</p>
