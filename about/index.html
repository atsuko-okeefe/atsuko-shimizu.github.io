      <p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto">Kyoto, Japan</a>.
I was quite a tomboy growing up.
My neighbor friend, Satoshi and I used to bike around our neighborhood all the time; one of us would come down a hill, the other would go up the hill, and we would crash into each other!
I have a picture at home where I am smiling big and Satoshi is smiling, also, but with bandages wrapped around his head.</p>

<p>I worked as a preschool teacher in Japan.
That was where I learned about Montessori education.
I took a Montessori Primary School workshop in Japan, and I couldn’t believe what I was hearing about how children would learn in a Montessori classroom.
I had to go and observe a classroom for myself.
That is when I fell in love with Montessori education.</p>

<p>I took a primary teacher training in British Columbia, Canada.
My trainer, Mrs. Nicole Marchuck looked like Dr. Maria Montessori herself &mdash; very peaceful, patient, and loving.
It was my very first time to learn things in English.
You can imagine how patient and loving she needed to be!
After the training, I got a job in San Mateo, CA.
There were three teachers in the classroom: one speaking in English, one speaking in Chinese, and one speaking in Japanese (me).
The children in the classroom naturally learned those three languages.
I loved working with my students, but an elementary Montessori teacher, who was my coworker, inspired me about elementary Montessori education.
That was when I decided to move to Milwaukee, WI to take the <a href="https://montessorimilwaukee.org/">elementary teacher training</a>.</p>

<p>This eventually led me to come to Colorado!
After the training I worked at a private school in Denver for a couple of years.
Those children were absolutely wonderful, but I wanted to work at a public school where I can help make Montessori education available to many more children.
It was again time for me to go back to school to get my Colorado State teacher’s license.
During that time, I came to Lincoln Elementary School and observed Ms. Therese’s room.
My student teaching practice was held in Kinder/1<sup>st</sup> grade traditional class at Lincoln as well!
At the end of my student teaching, I learned that Lincoln was opening its second Montessori Elementary class.
I asked the principal (Mrs. Daphne Hunter at that time) if I could apply for the new position.
She said, ‟Oh, unfortunately, it is a <em>Montessori</em> teacher’s position.”
I said, ‟Yes, I am qualified for that.”
She said again, ‟Oh! That’s right! Please apply!”
…
So here I am; this is my 14<sup>th</sup> year at Lincoln.
Since starting at Lincoln, I taught 4 years in lower elementary class and then moved up to teach 5 years in upper elementary and then came back to lower elementary.
This is my fifth year teaching the lower elementary once again.</p>

<p>Along with bringing Montessori education to the children and all of you, I love bringing my own culture to my classroom.
When I taught Japanese songs in Japanese to my students for the first time, I was stunned by their singing.
They sounded just like Japanese children singing! I am also always delighted to see how much children enjoy learning the Japanese culture I bring to them.
Their hearts are always open to it.
Children are amazing!
Several of my former students visited Japan and a few of them speak Japanese now.
Last school year, I introduced my students to Taiko (Japanese drum).
The third graders made taiko drums with buckets and jeans; second graders sandpapered the bachi (taiko drum sticks) and first graders decorated the drums.
They learned to play the drum and they had a blast.
We were able to bring a Taiko group performance to the whole school last year as well.
What a joy I have been receiving!</p>

<p>I am happily married to a supportive and loving husband.
I love gardening, hiking, biking and playing Taiko.</p>

<p>I don’t want to forget to mention that all the things I am able to bring and teach aren’t brought by me alone.
I receive (and depend on!) numerous help from our wonderful parents.
Thank you!!!</p>

<p>I am one blessed teacher to be able to live in this beautiful country and work with such wonderful children and families!</p>
