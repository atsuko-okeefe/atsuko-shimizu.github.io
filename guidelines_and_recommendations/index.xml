      <description>Observation Guidelines Note: Because of the importance of establishing the children&amp;rsquo;s work period routine, we do not take visitors during the first ~2 months of the school year. We kindly ask for your patience and understanding.
Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to visit us.
During your observation, you may notice that the teacher is focusing her attention more on maintaining a stable work environment in the classroom than on introducing new lessons to the children.</description>
