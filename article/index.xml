      <description>The exercises of Practical Life resemble the simple work of life in the home: sweeping, dusting, washing dishes, etc. These purposeful activities help the child adapt to his new community, learn self-control and begin to see himself as a contributing party of the social unit. His intellect grows as he works with his hands; his personality becomes integrated as body and mind function as a unit.  &amp;mdash; Reference.</description>

      <description>Dr. Maria Montessori said that the first 24 years of life are made up of four planes of development:
 The 1st plane &amp;ndash; birth to 6 years old The 2nd plane &amp;ndash; 6 to 12 years old The 3rd plane &amp;ndash; 12 to 18 years old The 4th plane &amp;ndash; 18 to 24 years old  The 1st and 2nd planes of development are complementary and they constitute childhood.</description>

      <title>Going Out</title>

      <description>Going out is not a field trip. A field trip is planned and organized by the teacher and the whole class goes out together under the teacher&amp;rsquo;s lead. In contrast, going out is a work that the child initiates and carries out.
During the 1st plane of development (birth to age 6), children need to adapt both to the environment of their family and to the life that family is living.</description>

      <description>We help children prepare for their life not only for middle school or high-school.
 Dr. Maria Montessori said that her method was to give aid to all aspects of life.
It was through Dr. Maria Montessori&amp;rsquo;s observations of children that she recognized the constructive power within any human person. That observation made her significantly aware of the importance of liberty. However, it is not liberty on its own that will allow for the positive construction of human beings.</description>
