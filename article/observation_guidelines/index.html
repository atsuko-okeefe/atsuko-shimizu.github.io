<p><strong>Note:</strong>
<em>Because of the importance of establishing the children&rsquo;s work period routine, we do not take visitors during the first ~2 months of the school year.
We kindly ask for your patience and understanding.</em></p>

<p>Welcome!
Thank you for taking the time to visit us.</p>

<p>During your observation, you may notice that the teacher is focusing her attention more on maintaining a stable work environment in the classroom than on introducing new lessons to the children.
This is necessary to maintain a productive working environment.</p>

<p>Please understand that the presence of additional adults can affect the dynamics of the classroom.
Therefore, we kindly ask that you follow the guidelines below to minimize the impact you may have on our students’ normal daily activities, their focus, and their concentration.</p>

<ul>
<li>Observations are by appointment only.</li>
<li>If more than one family member would like to observe, please limit observation to one person at a time and no more than 30 minutes per family per day.</li>
<li>Please silence your cell phone prior to entering the classroom.</li>
<li>Please come in as quietly as possible and find the teacher.
She/he will guide you to the visitor’s chair.</li>
<li>Please remain in the visitor’s chair.</li>
<li>Please refrain from initiating interaction with the children.</li>
<li>The children may approach you and introduce themselves, or offer a cup of tea.
You are most welcome to tell them your name and that you are there to observe them using a quiet voice, but please refrain from lengthy conversations.</li>
<li>Please write down what you see in the classroom and what the children are doing.</li>
<li>Please note any questions and discoveries you may have.
The teacher will provide you with paper and pen.
(Or you may bring your own.)
We will be most happy to schedule a follow-up appointment either by phone or in person to discuss your observation.
Your cooperation is much appreciated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy your observation!</p>
